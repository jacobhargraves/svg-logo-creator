# SVG Logo Creator

## Description

This NodeJS project was created to help users create a quick and simple logo using an svg file.  It allows the user to select a shape as well as 3 characters to be added to the center of that shape along with colors for both the shape and text.  After the user has selected their criteria, the app will produce a logo.svg file for the user to use.
